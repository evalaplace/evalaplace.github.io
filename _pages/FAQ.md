**Are you related to [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace), the famous physicist and mathematician?**

Of course! Why else would I do what I do? 
Jokes aside, sorry to disappoint, but it looks like we are not related. My last name is pretty common in France. We may have close common ancestors though since some parts of my ancestry is French.

**Are you French or German?**

Short answer: I'm both.

I hold the passport of both countries and was raised bilingual. To confuse you even more, my entire school education was in international schools and I obtained both the French and the German diplomae when I graduated. While my school education was in France, my university education was in Germany.
Now that I lived abroad for many years and use primarily English in my daily life, I believe that there is no language that I speak or write better between the two. I feel more French when I’m in Germany and more German when I’m in France. When describing my national identity, I prefer the label European.
