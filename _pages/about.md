Welcome to my webpage! I'm an assistant professor at the KU Leuven (Belgium) and a Veni fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

At the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) of KU Leuven, I lead a research team on themes related to stellar astrophysics. In particular, we study the evolution 
of massive binary and multiple systems, their explosions, pulsations, and afterlives. I'm the PI of the FWO-Odysseus grant *StarHearts* and of an NWO-Veni grant. In addition, I'm member of the [Anton Pannekoek Institute](https://api.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam, and of the [Leuven Gravity Institute](https://www.kuleuven.be/lgi).

My research is of theoretical nature, using numerical simulations to study the Universe.
