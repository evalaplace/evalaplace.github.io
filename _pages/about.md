Welcome to my webpage! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/), Germany, in the Stellar Evolution Theory
group led by [Fabian Schneider](https://www.fabian-schneider.com/).
 
My research focuses mainly on stellar astrophysics, in particular on the evolution of binary and multiple systems, their explosions, and afterlives. I am particularly 
interested in binary evolution, stellar explosions, compact object mergers, unexplained stellar transients, X-ray binaries, and gravitational-wave progenitors. 
For my research I mainly employ numerical simulations to compute detailed stellar models (with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/)) and 
supernova light-curves (with [SNEC](https://stellarcollapse.org/SNEC) 
and [MOSFiT](https://mosfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)). I also have a background in X-ray timing analysis with the RXTE, MAXI, Swift, and Fermi telescopes.
