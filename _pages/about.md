<span style="color:blue">**News**: I am currently on the job market and looking for postdoctoral fellowships starting in Fall 2021 </span>.

I’m a PhD candidate in astrophysics at the [Anton Pannekoek Institute](https://api.uva.nl/) entering my final year and interested in massive binary stars, 
supernovae explosions, and gravitational-wave sources. I'm part of the 
BinCosmos group led by [Selma de Mink](http://www.selmademink.com/). My co-advisor is Stephen Justham. 

My PhD work focuses on understanding the late-time evolution, death, 
and after-life of "stripped stars", massive stars that have lost
their outer layers due to interactions in binary systems. To 
this end, I perform numerical simulations with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) and [SNEC](https://stellarcollapse.org/SNEC) 
and [MOSFiT](https://mosfit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). 
My research interests include the evolution of massive stars, 
supernovae, X-ray binaries, unexplained transients, and 
 gravitational-wave progenitors. Learn more about this in 
 the [research](/research/) section.
 
 I'm also interested in developing computing tools for astrophysics. Tools I have developed or am currently developing include a real-time monitor of the activity of 
 Be X-ray binaries, and TULIPS, the Tool for Understanding the Lives, Interiors, and Physics of Stars. Learn more about this in 
 the [computing tools](/tools/) section.

 
Before I began my PhD, I 
completed a Bachelor of Science and then a Master of 
Science degree in physics at the 
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/), Germany. I specialized in the field of high energy astrophysics and 
 focused on understanding the properties of accreting X-ray pulsars and Be X-ray binaries. I completed my Bachelor thesis 
 at the [European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC), in Madrid, Spain, during a three months traineeship. 
  During my Master's thesis, I had the privilege to visit the [MAXI](http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.html) team laboratory in [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rnc/high_ener_astro/), Wako-shi, Japan,
 for an extended stay of 9 months.

For my research projects, I had the opportunity to work at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/) 
in Tokyo, Japan (2019), at the [Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/astronomie-astrophysik/institut/astronomie/forschung/prof-santangelo-abteilung-hochenergieastrophysik/)
in Tübingen, Germany (2013-2017), at [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rnc/high_ener_astro/), near Tokyo, Japan (2016),
 and at the [European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC) in Madrid, Spain (Summers 2014 and 2015). More details can be found in the [CV](/cv/) section.
