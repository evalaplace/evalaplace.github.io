Welcome to my webpage! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/), Germany, in the Stellar Evolution Theory
group led by [Fabian Schneider](https://www.fabian-schneider.com/).
 
My research focuses mainly on stellar astrophysics, in particular on the evolution of binary and multiple systems, their explosions, and afterlives. I am particularly interested in the evolution of massive stars, 
supernovae, X-ray binaries, unexplained transients, and gravitational-wave progenitors.
