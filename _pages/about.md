Welcome to my webpage! I'm an assistant professor at the KU Leuven (Belgium) and a Veni fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

At the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) of KU Leuven, I lead the research team *StarHearts* on themes related to stellar astrophysics. 
Our research focus is the study of massive binary and multiple systems, their evolution, explosions, pulsations, and afterlives. I'm the PI of an FWO-Odysseus grant and of an NWO-Veni grant. 
In addition, I'm a member of the [Anton Pannekoek Institute](https://api.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam, and of the [Leuven Gravity Institute](https://www.kuleuven.be/lgi).

My research is of theoretical nature, using numerical simulations to study the Universe.
