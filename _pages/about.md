Welcome to my webpage! I'm an assistant professor at the KU Leuven (Belgium) and Veni fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

At the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) of KU Leuven, I lead a research team on themes related to stellar astrophysics, the evolution 
of binary and multiple systems, their explosions, pulsations, and afterlives and am the PI of the FWO-Odysseus grant "StarHearts". 
I'm also a member of the [Anton Pannekoek Institute](https://api.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam and of the [Leuven Gravity Institute](https://www.kuleuven.be/lgi).

My research focuses mainly on massive binary star evolution, stellar explosions, gravitational-waves progenitors, unexplained transients, and asteroseismology.
