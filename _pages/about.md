Welcome to my webpage! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/), Germany, in the Stellar Evolution Theory
group led by [Fabian Schneider](https://www.fabian-schneider.com/).
 
My research focuses mainly on stellar astrophysics, in particular on the life, explosion, and afterlife of stars 
that are part of massive binary systems. I am also interested in high energy astrophysics and in the development of computing tools for astrophysics.
For more information about my research, please check the [publications](/publications/) section.

I'm also interested in developing computing tools for astrophysics. Learn more about this in 
the [computing tools](/tools/) section.



Feel free to [contact](mailto:e.c.laplace@uva.nl) me.
