Welcome to my webpage! I'm an assistant professor at KU Leuven and a Veni fellow at the University of Amsterdam.
 
My research focuses mainly on stellar astrophysics, in particular on the evolution of binary and multiple systems, their explosions, and afterlives. I am particularly interested in the evolution of massive stars, 
supernovae, X-ray binaries, unexplained transients, and gravitational-wave progenitors.
