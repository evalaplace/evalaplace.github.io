# Summary 

In 2025, I started a new research group as assistant professor in Asteroseismology, Binary Evolution, and Gravitational-Wave Progenitors at the KU Leuven (Belgium). 
My team  "StarHearts" is funded by an FWO Odysseus grant and a KU Leuven starting grant. Until February 2026, I will work (40%) as a NWO-Veni fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands).

A detailed, up-to-date list of my publications can be found at [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/MsPZZawhQSG7g0YRmqvmog) or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1009-5691).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher  at the 
[Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/), Germany, in the 
group of [Fabian Schneider](https://www.fabian-schneider.com/), where I worked on the pre-supernova properties of massive binary stars, the formation of black holes, and stellar explosions, and also led the outreach project [Habitable](https://www.hochschulwettbewerb.net/2023/heidelberg/). 
 
I completed my PhD at the [Anton Pannekoek Institute](https://api.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in the
BinCosmos group led by [Selma de Mink](http://www.selmademink.com/), with Stephen Justham as a co-advisor. My PhD work focused on understanding the late-time evolution, death,
and after-life of "binary-stripped stars", massive stars that have lost
their outer layers due to interactions in binary systems. To 
this end, I performed numerical simulations with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) and [SNEC](https://stellarcollapse.org/SNEC).
I am also interested in developing computing tools for astrophysics. Tools I have developed or am currently developing include a real-time monitor of the activity of Be X-ray binaries, and TULIPS, the Tool for Understanding the Lives, Interiors, and Physics of Stars. Learn more about these in 
 the [computing tools](/tools/) section.

Before I began my PhD, I 
completed a Bachelor of Science and then a Master of 
Science degree in physics at the 
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/), Germany. I specialized in the field of high energy astrophysics and 
 focused on understanding the properties of accreting X-ray pulsars and Be X-ray binaries. I completed my Bachelor thesis 
 at the [European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC), in Madrid, Spain, during a three months traineeship. 
  During my Master's thesis, I had the privilege to visit the [MAXI](http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.html) team laboratory in [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rnc/high_ener_astro/), Wako-shi, Japan,
 for an extended stay of 9 months.

For my research projects, I had the opportunity to work at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/) 
in Tokyo, Japan (2019), at the [Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/astronomie-astrophysik/institut/astronomie/forschung/prof-santangelo-abteilung-hochenergieastrophysik/)
in Tübingen, Germany (2013-2017), 
at [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rnc/high_ener_astro/), near Tokyo, Japan (2016),
 and at the [European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC) in Madrid, Spain (Summers 2014 and 2015).

Originally, I come from Strasbourg (France). I'm European, with French and German nationalities.
I am committed to promoting an inclusive, diverse, and safe work environment and more sustainable practices in the times of climate crisis. 
Outside of work, I enjoy sports, in particular running and cycling, spending time with friends and family, and noticing the natural beauty of this world.
