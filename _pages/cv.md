# Summary 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher  at the 
[Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/), Germany, in the 
group of [Fabian Schneider](https://www.fabian-schneider.com/). My activities include conducting research on the physics of massive single and binary stars and the formation
of black holes and supernovae, co-advising and mentoring students, organizing scientific meetings, and participating in outreach activities, including leading the project
[Habitable](https://www.hochschulwettbewerb.net/2023/heidelberg/). 
I am committed to promoting an inclusive, diverse, and safe work environment and more sustainable practices in the times of climate crisis. 
Outside of work, I enjoy sports, in particular running and cycling, spending time with friends, playing with my niblings,
and noticing the natural beauty of this world.
 
I completed my PhD at the [Anton Pannekoek Institute](https://api.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in the
BinCosmos group led by [Selma de Mink](http://www.selmademink.com/), with Stephen Justham as a co-advisor. 

My PhD work focused on understanding the late-time evolution, death,
and after-life of "binary-stripped stars", massive stars that have lost
their outer layers due to interactions in binary systems. To 
this end, I performed numerical simulations with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) and [SNEC](https://stellarcollapse.org/SNEC).
 I am also interested in developing computing tools for astrophysics. Tools I have developed or am currently developing include a real-time monitor of the activity of 
 Be X-ray binaries, and TULIPS, the Tool for Understanding the Lives, Interiors, and Physics of Stars. Learn more about these in 
 the [computing tools](/tools/) section.

 
Before I began my PhD, I 
completed a Bachelor of Science and then a Master of 
Science degree in physics at the 
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/), Germany. I specialized in the field of high energy astrophysics and 
 focused on understanding the properties of accreting X-ray pulsars and Be X-ray binaries. I completed my Bachelor thesis 
 at the [European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC), in Madrid, Spain, during a three months traineeship. 
  During my Master's thesis, I had the privilege to visit the [MAXI](http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.html) team laboratory in [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rnc/high_ener_astro/), Wako-shi, Japan,
 for an extended stay of 9 months.

For my research projects, I had the opportunity to work at the [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/) 
in Tokyo, Japan (2019), at the [Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/astronomie-astrophysik/institut/astronomie/forschung/prof-santangelo-abteilung-hochenergieastrophysik/)
in Tübingen, Germany (2013-2017), 
at [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/rnc/high_ener_astro/), near Tokyo, Japan (2016),
 and at the [European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC) in Madrid, Spain (Summers 2014 and 2015).
