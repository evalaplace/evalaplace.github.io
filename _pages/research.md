## The lives, deaths and afterlives of stars stripped in binary systems

Most massive stars live in binaries. Due to interactions between binary stars, the initially
most massive component loses its Hydrogen-rich envelope and becomes a stripped star. At the end of their lives,
these objects give rise to faint and fast transient events that can now be observed thanks to a new generation
of transient surveys such as ZTF, Las Cumbres Observatory, or LSST). However, theoretical models for their
progenitor structures and light-curves are still lacking.

Better understanding these systems is particularly important in our era of multi-messenger astrophysics since
they are the progenitors of the most energetic explosions in the universe, supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and naturally
lead to the formation of gravitational-wave sources.

My PhD project aims at exploring the evolution of stripped stars from interacting binaries, and at understanding
their explosion properties by computing their detailed stellar structures and light-curves using 1D hydrodynamic
simulation codes (MESA for the binary evolution and SNEC for the Supernova explosion).
