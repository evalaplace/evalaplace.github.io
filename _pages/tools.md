<span style="color:red">**Update November 2020:** I have just been awarded the 5000 Euro outreach award of the Royal 
Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities through the de Zeeuw-van Disshoeck fund
for developing the TULIPS project further. For more information, see the press release: 
[original in Dutch](https://www.astronomie.nl/nieuws/eva-laplace-wint-communicatieprijs-voor-software-die-levensloop-van-ster-toont-2542) or 
[English translation](https://www.astronomie.nl/eva-laplace-wins-communication-prize-for-software-that-shows-life-cycle-of-stars-92)</span>

During a traineeship at the European Space Astronomy Centre in 2014, I developed the BeXRB monitor, a tool for detecting 
the activity of Be X-ray binaries from three different X-ray space telescopes in near real time using python, MySQL, 
PHP, and JavaScript.
The code is still actively used, hosted, and maintained today by the European Space Agency 
([Link to the BeXRB monitor](http://integral.esac.esa.int/bexrbmonitor/webpage_oneplot.php))
