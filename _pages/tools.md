**TULIPS**

TULIPS, the Tool for Understanding the Lives, Interiors, and Physics of Stars, helps visualize the physics of how stars evolve over time in an intuitive manner. 
Instead of complex diagrams, stars are represented as circles that change in size and color over time.
 I developed this tool during my PhD and was awarded the ET outreach award of the Royal 
Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities to develop it further. The code is still actively developed and maintained today.

**BeXRB monitor**

During a traineeship at the European Space Astronomy Centre in 2014, I developed the BeXRB monitor, a tool for detecting 
the activity of Be X-ray binaries from three different X-ray space telescopes in near real time using python, MySQL, 
PHP, and JavaScript.
The code is still actively used, hosted, and maintained today by the European Space Agency
