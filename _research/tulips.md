TULIPS helps visualize the physics of how stars evolve over time in an intuitive manner. Instead of complex diagrams, 
stars are represented as circles that change in size and color over time. I have been developing TULIPS since 2018 and 
plan to publish it as open-source and free software in the first half of 2021. 


With the Outreach award of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities, I am planning to further develop TULIPS 
and to make tutorials and videos of TULIPS available. Stay tuned!

loses and generate energy over the course of its life. The radius of the circle is proportional to the mass of the star. 
Redder colors indicate a very high energy generation (for example through nuclear fusion) and more purple colors 
indicate heavy energy losses (for example through neutrino emission). In the lower left corner, you can see a classical 
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.</span>
