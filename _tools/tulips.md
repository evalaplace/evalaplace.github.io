## The TULIPS code
TULIPS helps visualize the physics of how stars evolve over time in an intuitive manner. Instead of complex diagrams, 
stars and their interior properties are represented as circles that change in size and color over time. 

You can find the TULIPS code at [this link](https://bitbucket.org/elaplace/tulips/src/master/) and documentation and tutorials [here](https://astro-tulips.readthedocs.io).

loses and generate energy over the course of its life. The radius of the circle is proportional to the mass of the star. 
Redder colors indicate a very high energy generation (for example through nuclear fusion) and more purple colors 
indicate heavy energy losses (for example through neutrino emission). In the lower left corner, you can see a classical 
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram."%}{: .align-center}

For more information, have a look at a one-hour presentation I gave about TULIPS at a lunch seminar of the Anton Pannekoek Institute,
University of Amsterdam:

## History
I have been developing TULIPS since 2018 and it was published in 2021.
With the outreach award of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities sponsored by the de Zeeuw-van Disshoeck fund (press releases: 
[original in Dutch](https://www.astronomie.nl/nieuws/eva-laplace-wint-communicatieprijs-voor-software-die-levensloop-van-ster-toont-2542) or 
[English translation](https://www.astronomie.nl/eva-laplace-wins-communication-prize-for-software-that-shows-life-cycle-of-stars-92))
the project could be developed further, and documentation and tutorials could be included.
